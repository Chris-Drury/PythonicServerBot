# PythonicServerBot
A Discord bot made by myself for remote control of different game servers

Every bit of this bot is supposed to be a sarcastic asshole. If you don't like the casual humour, you won't like mine either.

# installation:
Currently this bot is private and cannot be installed without my own input.

This will eventually change when possible.

Two environment variables will need to be setup:
* DISCORD_TOKEN: This is the secure O-AUTH token to let the bot connect to Discord.
* FTB_SERVER_IP: This should be the public IP of the machine that is hosting the FTB server.
